# Learn Bash

## ARRAYS (Exercise 4 of 11)

If you are already familiar with arrays in other programming languages,
you won't be surprised here.

An array in bash is a variable that allows you to refer to multiple
values. In bash, arrays are also zero-based, that is, the first element in
an array has an index of 0.

When dealing with arrays, we should be aware of the special environment
variable IFS. IFS or Input Field Separator — is the character that
separates elements in an array.

The default value is an empty space `IFS=''`.

## Array declaration

In bash you create an array by simply assigning a value to an index in the
array variable:

```bash
fruits[0]=Apple
fruits[1]=Pear
fruits[2]=Plum
echo ${fruits[*]} # echo ${fruits[@]} may be used as well
```

Array variables can also be created using compound assignments such as:

```bash
fruits=(Apple Pear Plum)
```

</br>

## Array slice

Also, we can extract a slice of an array using the slice operators:

```bash
echo ${fruits[*]:0:2} # Apple Pear
echo ${@:1:2} # slice of positional parameters
```

In the example above, `fruits[*]` returns the entire contents of the array,
and `:0:2` extracts the slice of length 2, that starts at index 0.

</br>

## Adding elements into an array

Adding elements into an array is quite simple too. Compound assignments
are specially useful in this case. We can use them like this:

```bash
fruits=(Orange ${fruits[*]} Banana Cherry)
echo ${fruits[*]} # Orange Apple Pear Plum Banana Cherry
```

In the example above, `fruits[*]` represents the entire contents of the
array and substitutes it into the compound assignment, then assigns the
new value into the fruits array, mutating its original value.

</br>

## Deleting elements from an array

To delete an element from an array, use the unset command:

```bash
unset fruits[0]
echo ${fruits[*]} # Apple Pear Plum Banana Cherry
```

</br>

## THE CHALLENGE

Create a file named arrays.bash.

A few values will be passed into your script through positional
parameters. As you already know, all parameters which were passed into the
script are stored in $* and $@ variables. These variables are none other
than arrays.

You should take slice of elements consisting of the second to third items
(eventually two items). Save these elements into a new array. Add to the
beginning of the array two new items, I and am. Add to the end of the
array two items: and and the fourth positional argument.

Output all elements of the array.

For example, if you run your script with these arguments:

**>** `./arrays.bash awesome cool strong cute awesome`

The script must output this:

```txt
I am cool strong and cute
```

</br>

## Awesome

Now you know how to deal with arrays in Bash. They are handy for storing
collections of data. For example, you may use arrays for saving the list
of enabled plugins or commands which must be executed.

In previous exercises you have learned how to get your current directory
using the pwd command. You may want to change the current directory. You
can do this using the cd command like so:

**>** `cd ~/Projects/my-awesome-project`
