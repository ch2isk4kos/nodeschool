/*
  You can access and manipulate object properties –– the keys and values
  that an object contains –– using a method very similar to arrays called bracket notation:

      const example = {
       pizza: 'yummy'
     }

     console.log(example['pizza'])

  Alternately, you can use dot notation to get identical results:

     console.log(example.pizza)
*/

const food = {
  types: "only pizza",
};

console.log(food.types);
